 Analyzing Tweets to Predict City Origin and If it went Viral using Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbors Algorithms
 
 For Project 1 (viral_tweets.ipynb) I used K nearest neighbors algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral based on a variety of numerical features
 
 For Project 2 (tweet_location.ipynb) I used naive bayes algorithm as a classification algorithm to try to predict what city a tweet was from using the content of the tweet.
